# Who shit my pants?

I stepped out onto the night. It was hot enough fry an egg and it smelled like eggs too… the weather was fine though. I tell you, it ain’t easy being the patsy for a two-bit bum-runner. It wasn’t me what done the dirty deed in my dungarees - you gotta believe me! I got a BM schedule like a veteran jazz singer… I always know when to scat. There was a patty cake on daddy’s cake and I had my baker’s man. I just needed proof… and a shower. I could tell by the smug look on the suspect’s face that he was full of it - and I don’t mean shit, ‘cause all of his was in my khaki’s giving the pleats a good steam. I had his number… and it was two… and it was in my pants. The party was over and I’d danced cheek-to-cheek - thing is, it takes two to salsa and this salsa… was extra chunky.
